# Test Task Project

A modern web application built with Next.js 15, React, Material-UI, and React Query for viewing and saving user information with weather data.

## Task Overview

The application allows users to:
- View random user information fetched from API
- Display current weather for each user's location
- Save users to local storage (IndexedDB)
- View saved users in a separate page
- Load more users with pagination

### Features Implemented

**Main Route:**
- User cards displaying: name, gender, profile image, location, email
- Weather information: icon, current temperature, min/max for the day
- Save button to store user in IndexedDB
- Weather button to show detailed weather in modal
- Load more users functionality

**Saved Users Route:**
- List of saved users with similar card design
- Remove button instead of save button
- Weather functionality available

**Bonus Points Implemented:**
-  **Update current temperature periodically (every 5 minutes)** - implemented with React Query automatic refetch
-  **Use Next.js API for handling all 3rd party requests** - custom API routes for users and weather
-  **Store saved user in IndexedDB instead of localStorage** - full IndexedDB implementation
-  **Responsive design** - looks good on mobile and desktop devices

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** - React framework for production
- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Material-UI (MUI)** - React component library for faster development
- **React Query** - Data fetching and state management library
